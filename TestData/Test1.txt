And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to
 a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, one girl
 sitting on her own in a small caf in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was 
that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could 
be made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one 
would have to get nailed to anything.
Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful one—more
 popular than the Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better selling than Fifty More 
Things to do in Zero Gravity, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy 
of philosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some More of God's Greatest
 Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway?
As it is I went to lie in a field, along with my Hitch Hiker's Guide to Europe, 
and when the stars came out it occurred to me that if only someone would write a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as well, then I for one would be off like a shot. Having had this thought I promptly fell asleep and forgot about it for six years.
I went to Cambridge University. I took a number of baths—and a degree in English. 
I worried a lot about girls and what had happened to my bike. Later I became a writer and worked on a lot of things that were almost incredibly successful but in fact just failed to see the light of day. Other writers will know what I mean.
My pet project was to write something that would combine comedy and science
 fiction, and it was this obsession that drove me into deep debt and despair.
 No one was interested, except finally one man a BBC radio producer named Simon 
Brett who had had the same idea, comedy and science fiction. Although Simon only
 produced the first episode before leaving the BBC to concentrate on his own
 writing (he is best known in the United Stares for his excellent Charles Paris
 detective novels), I owe him an immense debt of gratitude for simply getting the thing to happen in the first place. He was succeeded by the legendary Geoffrey Perkins.
In its original form the show was going to be rather different. I was feeling a little disgruntled with the world at the time and had put together about six different plots, each of which ended with the destruction of the world in a different way, and for a different reason. It was to be called “The Ends of the Earth”.
While I was filling in the details of the first plot—in which the Earth was demolished to make way for a new hyperspace express route—I realized that I needed to have someone from another planet around to tell the reader what was going on, to give the story the context it needed. So I had to work out who he was and what he was doing on the Earth.
