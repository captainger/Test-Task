Go Go Gophers  is a western/comedy animated series.
They make attempts to secure the town of Gopher Gulch by wiping out the last two 
surviving Gopher Indians (depicted as anthropomorphic gophers): Running Board 
(voiced by George S. Irving) and Ruffled Feathers (also voiced by Sandy Becker).
 However, the Gophers prove to be very clever and always manage to foil the plans 
of Colonel Coyote and Sergeant Oakey Homa. Whenever they came up with an idea to 
stop their adversaries, Ruffled Feathers would break into gibberish as he tried to
 explain it and Running Board always seemed to understand what he was saying.
 They are also aided by Colonel Coyote's own incompetence and ineptitude and 
also by his constantly ignoring the advice of Sergeant Homa, who is much more
 perceptive. In one episode, they actually mention that they need Colonel Coyote 
to stay in charge so that they can continue living in Gopher Gulch, worrying that 
any other replacement will prove to be impossible to deal with and might succeed 
in his mission to remove them.
